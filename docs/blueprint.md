## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) to convey a sense of technology and forward-thinking design.
- Background color: Dark navy blue (#191970), desaturated from the primary, for a modern, professional feel.
- Accent color: Purple (#800080), chosen as an analogous color to add depth and highlight interactive elements without overwhelming the design.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that ensures legibility and a contemporary look across all text elements.
- Use simple, outlined icons for elements like the show/hide password toggle.
- Center the login form on the page within a card with slightly rounded corners to soften the overall aesthetic.
- Use a subtle fade-in animation when the page loads.
